# WideVariant: Lieberman Lab SNP calling pipeline


## Overview

This pipeline and toolkit is used to detect and analyze single nucleotide differences between closely related bacterial isolates. 

* Noteable features
	* Avoids false-negative mutations due to low coverage; if a mutation is found in at least one isolate in a set, the evidence at that position will be investigated to make a best-guess call.
	* Avoids false-positives mutations by facilitating visualization of raw data, across samples (whereas pileup formats must be investigated on a sample-by-sample basis) and changing of threshold to best fit your use case.
	* Enables easy evolutionary analysis, including phylogenetic construction, nonsynonmous vs synonymous mutation counting, and parallel evolution


* Inputs (to Snakemake cluster step): 
	* short-read sequencing data of closely related bacterial isolates
	* an annotated reference genome
* Outputs (of local analysis step): 
	* table of high-quality SNVs that differentiate isolates from each other
	* parsimony tree of how the isolates are related to each other 

The pipeline is split into two main components, as described below. A complete tutorial can be found at the bottom of this page.


### 1. Snakemake pipeline

The first portion of WideVariant aligns raw sequencing data from bacterial isolates to a reference genome, identifies candidate SNV positions, and creates useful data structure for supervised local data filtering. This step is implemented in a workflow management system called [Snakemake](http://snakemake.readthedocs.io) and is executed on a [SLURM cluster](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html). More information is available [here](readme_files/readme_snake_main.md).


### 2. Local python analysis

The second portion of WideVariant filters candidate SNVs based on data arrays generated in the first portion and generates a high-quality SNV table and a parsimony tree. This step is implemented with a custom python script. More information can be found [here](readme_files/readme_local_main.md).
